Subject: [PATCH 13/18] envsetup: set OUT_DIR to an absolute path always

OUT_DIR was set to $(TOPDIR)out previously,
but $(TOPDIR) was null, so it was a relative path.
This broke releasetools, inline kernel building, etc
since they require absolute paths.
Fix it so that it is set to $(shell readlink -f .)/out
if $(TOPDIR) is null.

Also remove hacks which checked if (OUT_DIR) was out
and changed it to $(ANDROID_BUILD_TOP)/out to workaround
the aforementioned problem.
